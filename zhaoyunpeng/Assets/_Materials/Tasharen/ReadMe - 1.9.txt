Thank you for buying Tasharen Water!

----------------------------------------------
 Usage
----------------------------------------------

* Drag & drop the "Tasharen Water" prefab into your scene.
  This prefab can be found in Assets/Tasharen/Water.

----------------------------------------------
 Material Properties
----------------------------------------------

* Normal Map has the normal map's XYZ in RGB channels and the foam texture in the alpha channel.
* Reflection texture is created automatically, and is used in medium quality water and higher.
* Skybox is used to "fake" reflection, and is used in low quality water.
* Shallow Color controls the color of the water considered to be "shallow".
* Deep Color controls the color of the water where the water is as deep as it can get.
* Specular color controls the strength of the specular highlights.
* Shininess controls how shiny your water is going to be.
* Tiling controls the tiling of the normal map's texture.
* Reflection Tint controls how bright the reflection is going to be.
* Inverse Alpha, Depth and Color ranges control the foam and depth of the water.

----------------------------------------------
 Script Properties
----------------------------------------------

* Quality controls the quality of the water. The lower the quality, the higher the performance.
* High Reflection Mask controls what will be reflected at High and Uber quality levels.
* Medium Reflection Mask controls what will be reflected at the Medium quality level.
* Keep Under Camera option will keep the water underneath the camera at all times.
  This is useful if you don't want to place the water manually. It will always travel
  with the main camera (and thus -- the player), remaining at the height of 0.
